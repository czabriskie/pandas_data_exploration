## Pandas/Git Assignment

You will work in a group of two or three on this assignment. To complete the assignment

1. Clone the repository to your local computer
2. Do a thorough analysis on the data including summary statistics, visualizations, etc. Is there anything odd or unexpected about the data?
3. As a group, answer 5 questions you have about the data that will be insightful to the business

### Bonus
4. See how well you can model the order price using linear regression. Make sure the model follows the model assumptions, and the data is ready for modeling before jumping into it. 

I will specifically be looking for one jupyter notebook that all members of the team have worked on. I will be checking what merges each person made to contribute to the project. Create branches, commit, push, pull, and merge often to collaborate with your group. Please don't just email each other code and copy and paste in one document. This will be good practice actually using Git to collaborate with others.

Jupyter is a very good tool for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Make sure you comment using markdown in Jupyter on what you are doing, and what the results are of your analysis, and model.
