## Pandas/Git Assignment

You will work in a group of two or three on this assignment. To complete the assignment

1. Clone the repository to your local computer
2. As a group, Answer three questions you have about the data like I demonstrated in class
3. Answer Bill's question and create some slides for him from the previous group discussion. If you will remember his prompt was

Heya how are you doing? Would you mind taking a look at this data for me? Chandi asked me if I thought allowing customers to book over a year in advance was actually increasing the rooms we book. It would be great to have some more information before going into that meeting tomorrow. Would you also mind making some slides for me?

Thanks!

Bill

I will specifically be looking for one jupyter notebook that all members of the team have worked on. I will be checking what merges each person made to contribute to the project (Please don't just email each other code and copy and paste in one document. This will be good practice actually using Git to collaborate with others)
